Kernel Requirements:
====================

On the host system, these two packages need to be installed:

* sys-kernel/hardened-sources-3.13.5
* sys-kernel/linux-firmware-20131230

To run:
=======

Execute ./<DM>-run.sh

Where <DM> is a desktop manager of three flavors of choice:

* Fluxbox
* Gnome3
* Xfce4

When your ISO is built, you can clean up by removing the th-<ARCH>-<DM>/
directory as it is no longer needed.

Enjoy! ;)
